## Bay Area Bike Share
You will be exploring and graphing the data from the Bay Area Bike Share.  

Download the data and review it well enough to understand the contents.  The data directory contains a README with further explanation.

This assignment has three parts:

1. Create a graph that is based on data from only one of the columns of the original data.  For example, this might be a histogram of that data.

2. Create a graph that is based on data from only two columns of the original data.  This might be a scatterplot, a faceted histogram, etc.

3. Create graph that is based on data from at least 3 columns of the original data.  This could be a colored scatterplot, a scatterplot matrix, faceted histograms, etc.

For each of the three parts, your goal should be to create the most interesting or insightful graph you can, given the constraints on how much data is used.  Create a separate document that explains why you find each graph insightful and/or what you learn from the results.
